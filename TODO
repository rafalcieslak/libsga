Core features:
 - Consider hardware antialiasing options
 - Data structure and arrays description (Array and struct uniforms)
 - Configurable depth buffer properties
 - Non-resizable windows
 - More verbose error messages
 - An option to disable vsync
 - A user should be able to hint that an image will be used mostly for sampling (so it shoudl stay in shader optimal layout)
 - Fix isVariableNameValid
 - Option to automatically close a window when Esc key is pressed

Build process:
 - Automatic release packaging on windows
 - Lite (headless) library version

Documentation:
 - Describe examples
 - Specify what exactly gets reset on target change.

Examples:
 - Toon shader
 - Interactive 3D function plot
 - Port terrain heightmap (?)
 - Fisheye rendering

Feature-level bugs:
 - Function naming: Polygon vs Primitive
 - Rename sgaWindowCoords to something not specific to a window, as the target may be a texture not a window
 - Rename sga*Coords to sga*Coord
