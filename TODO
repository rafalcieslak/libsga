Core features:
 - Consider hardware antialiasing options
 - Data structure and arrays description
 - Configurable per-output pipeline clear color
 - Configurable depth buffer properties
 - Viewport/scissor configuration
 - Indiced vertex mode
 - Consider moving shader_ptrs from outside sga classes to inside pimpl pointer
   (the proxy class would be a stateless shared reference to the impl object).
