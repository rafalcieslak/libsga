Core features:
 - Consider hardware antialiasing options
 - Data structure and arrays description
 - Configurable per-output pipeline clear color
 - Configurable depth buffer properties
 - Indiced vertex mode
 - Consider moving shader_ptrs from outside sga classes to inside pimpl pointer
   (the proxy class would be a stateless shared reference to the impl object).
 - Non-resizable windows

Build process:
 - Automatic release packaging on windows

Documentation:
 - Describe examples
 - Specify what exactly gets reset on target change.

Examples:
 - 3D movement with mouselook+WASD
 - Different materials on a scene
 - Shadow maps
 - Toon shader
 - Interactive 3D function plot
 - Port terrain heightmap (?)
 - Fisheye rendering

Feature-level bugs:
 - Function naming: Polygon vs Primitive
 - Rename sgaWindowCoords to something not specific to a window, as the target may be a texture not a window
 - Rename sga*Coords to sga*Coord
